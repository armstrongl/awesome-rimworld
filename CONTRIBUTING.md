## Adding an Item

### Requirements

- The item must be relevant to RimWorld (mods, tools, guides, or community resources)
- You should have personal experience with the item
- **Quality criteria for mods:**

  - No known game-breaking bugs or conflicts with popular mods

### Format

All items must follow this format:

```

**Important formatting rules:**

- Use `[Name](URL) - Description` format (space-dash-space between URL and description)
- Descriptions must end with proper punctuation (period, exclamation, or question mark)
- Keep descriptions concise (one sentence)
- Place items in alphabetical order within their category

### DLC Labels

If a mod or resource requires a specific DLC, add the appropriate label after the item name:

| -------- | ----- |
| Royalty  | 🏛️    |
| Ideology | 📿    |
| Biotech  | 🧬    |

- [Another Mod](https://url.com) 🏛️📿 - A mod requiring both Royalty and Ideology.
```
